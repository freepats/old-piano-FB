Recorded by Piotr Barcz from a Francis Bacon player piano. It's a wonderful historic piano with an authentic honky-tonk tone. The sounds were recorded in stereo with a Zoom H1n sound recorder, at the approximate position where the pianist's head would be, and they were sent to FreePats on February 2020. The sound bank was assembled by roberto@zenvoid.org.

It's quite difficult to find pianos like this nowadays, many thanks to Piotr for sharing these samples with us.
